# About Me

I'm a third-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu).
My interests in the field are diverse, but I am most interested in software engineering and web development.
I'm also a huge fan of robotics, game design, and mathematics.

## Computer Science

Computer Science is without a doubt my passion. When I was 11, I wanted to know how computer games were made,
so I got my hands on a free program (at the time) called Game Maker. My first programming language was Game Maker's
built-in scripting language, very creatively called "Game Maker Language." I later learned
Visual BASIC and Java in high school, as well as C++ and LabVIEW from my robotics team.

In summer of 2014, I interned at [Yelp](http://yelp.com), where I gained a good amount of experience
in full-stack Python, as well as modern software engineering practices. A huge chunk of the work I did involved
processing large datasets using the MapReduce paradigm to compute metrics for Yelp's Mobile Review Translation feature.

I'll be interning at [Google](http://google.com) in Summer 2015.

Right now, my strongest programming language is Python, and I am also quite experienced with Java, C, C++, and JavaScript.

## W3

I'm a huge fan of the Web. I've been making websites for around 5 years, so I'm super comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I wrote the back end of this website in Python. The website itself is a fairly minimalistic [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) app, though I've also got experience with various MVC frameworks.

## Robotics

I have a fairly strong background in robotics. I am on the software subteam of the [Cornell Mars Rover](http://marsrover.engineering.cornell.edu)
project team, where we program primarily in C++, and make good use of the [ROS](http://ros.org/) library. We do all of our development in Linux,
so I have managed to gain a great deal of experience with Unix tools and Bash scripting.

I am also a proud alum of a [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://usfirst.org) team, namely [Team 195](http://team195.com/).

## Music

I've been producing electronic music as a hobby for about 5 years, and I love sound design, though
I find myself listening to mostly classical music these days. I also enjoy playing the keyboard.
You can see a video of me playing the keyboard [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5B4GVYM3rk).
