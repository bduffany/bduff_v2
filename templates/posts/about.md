# About Me

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu).
My interests in the field are diverse, but I am most interested in software engineering and web development.
I'm also a huge fan of robotics, game design, and mathematics.

## Software

Software is without a doubt my passion.

I started programming when I was 11, making very simple games in Game Maker. I later learned
Visual BASIC and Java in high school, as well as C++ and LabVIEW from my high school robotics team.

In summer of 2014, I interned at [Yelp](http://yelp.com), where I gained a good amount of experience
in full-stack Python, as well as modern software engineering practices. A huge chunk of the work I did involved
processing large datasets using the MapReduce paradigm to compute metrics for Yelp's Mobile Review Translation feature.

In summer of 2015, I interned at [Google](http://google.com), where I worked mostly in Dart, writing
components in Angular2, and improving some internal front-end libraries.

Right now, my strongest programming language is Python, and I also am very proficient in Java, C, C++, Dart, and JavaScript.

## W3

I'm a huge fan of the Web. I started out writing simple layouts and scripts for
MySpace (ahh, nostalgia!) and I have been hooked ever since.

I wrote the back end of this website in Python. The website itself is a fairly
minimalistic [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) app.

## Robotics

I have a fairly strong background in robotics. I am on the software subteam of
the [Cornell Mars Rover](http://marsrover.engineering.cornell.edu) project
team, where we program primarily in C++, and use the [ROS](http://ros.org/) library.
All of our development is done in Linux.

I am also a proud alum of a [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://usfirst.org)
team, namely [Team 195](http://team195.com/). I programmed a robot that could
quickly hang inner tubes on racks (for the game
[Logo Motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_Motion)), and another robot
that played basketball (for the game [Rebound Rumble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_Rumble)).

## Music

I've been producing electronic music as a hobby for about 5 years, and I love sound design, though
I find myself listening to mostly classical music these days.

I also enjoy playing the digital piano ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5B4GVYM3rk)).
