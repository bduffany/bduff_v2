### About Me

I'm a college student from Connecticut. Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu) in Ithaca, New York.
My interests in the field are quite varied, but I am most interested in software engineering and web development.
I'm also a huge fan of mathematics, robotics, and game design.

#### Computer Science

Computer Science is without a doubt my passion. When I was 11, I wanted to know how computer games were made,
so I got my hands on a free program (at the time) called Game Maker 6. My first programming language was Game Maker's
built-in scripting language, very creatively called "Game Maker Language." I later learned
Visual BASIC and Java in high school, as well as C++ and LabVIEW from my robotics team.

In summer of 2014, I interned at [Yelp](http://yelp.com), during which time I gained a good amount of experience
in full-stack Python, as well as modern software engineering practices. A huge chunk of the work I did involved
processing large datasets using the MapReduce paradigm to compute metrics for Yelp's Mobile Review Translation feature.

Right now, my strongest programming language is Python, and I am also quite experienced with Java.
I also have plenty of experience with OCaml, C, C++, and JavaScript.
My favorite language is currently Python (but I'm also learning Scala at the moment, which is looking like a serious contender!).

#### W3

As a bit of an autodidact, and a big fan of the Web, I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a bit of MySQL.
I built this website from the ground up following the [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) paradigm.
The back end is written entirely in Python, and makes good use of the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) framework.

#### Robotics

I have a fairly strong background in robotics. I am on the software subteam of the [Cornell Mars Rover](http://marsrover.engineering.cornell.edu)
project team, where we program primarily in C++, and make good use of the [ROS](http://ros.org/) library. We do all of our development in Linux,
so I have managed to gain a great deal of experience with Unix tools and Bash scripting.

I am also a proud alum of a [FIRST Robotics](http://usfirst.org) team, namely [Team 195](http://team195.com/).

#### Music

I've been producing electronic music as a hobby for about 5 years, and I love sound design, though
I find myself listening to mostly classical music these days. I also enjoy playing the keyboard.
You can see a video of me playing the keyboard [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5B4GVYM3rk).
